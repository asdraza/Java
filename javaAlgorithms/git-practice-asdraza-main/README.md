COMP20290 Algorithms
This Repository contains all the algorithms done as part of this module. These include sorting algorithms, compression algorithms and several other algorithms.

IMPORTANT: I have also submitted all the code as a zip file if something fails to run


This includes:
##Practical 3 – Sorting: Generic implementation of the common sorting algorithms: Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Bogo Sort, Quick Sort.
##Practical 4 – Binary Search Algorithm: This doesn't perform as well because the algorithm's input has to be sorted which decreases the algorithm’s efficiency. This algorithm can be implemented both numerically and lexicographically.
##Practical 5 – String Searching: *Brute Force algorithm
                                  *Knuth-Morris-Prath Algorithm
##Practical 6 – RunLength Encoding
##Practical 7 – Huffman Compression: This is a way of  compressing and decompressing txt and bin files
##Practical 8 – Dynamic Programming (DP): Fibonacci
                                          Knapsack


*Getting Started
Just download the source files present in the repository to your own machine to get everything up and running.

*Prerequisites
These projects were done in Java (JDK 17)

**Steps for Installing JAVA
Go to the Manual download page
Click on Windows Online
The File Download dialog box appears prompting you to run or save the download file
To run the installer, click Run.
To save the file for later installation, click Save.
Choose the folder location and save the file to your local system.
Tip: Save the file to a known location on your computer, for example, to your desktop.
Double-click on the saved file to start the installation process.
The installation process starts. Click the Install button to accept the license terms and to continue with the installation.

Oracle has partnered with companies that offer various products. The installer may present you with option to install these programs when you install Java. After ensuring that the desired programs are selected, click the Next button to continue the installation.
A few brief dialogs confirm the last steps of the installation process; click Close on the last dialog. This will complete Java installation process.

**Installing
**Steps for Installing IntelliJ**
1. Download the installer .exe.

2. Run the installer and follow the wizard steps.

3. On the Installation Options step, you can configure the following:

4. Create a desktop shortcut for launching IntelliJ IDEA.

5. Add the directory with IntelliJ IDEA command-line launchers to the PATH environment variable to be able to run them from any working directory in the Command Prompt.

6. Add the Open Folder as Project action to the system context menu (when you right-click a folder).

7. Associate specific file extensions with IntelliJ IDEA to open them with a double-click.

8. To run IntelliJ IDEA, find it in the Windows Start menu or use the desktop shortcut. You can also run the launcher batch script or executable in the installation directory under bin.

**HOW TO RUN CODE IN INTELLIJ**
1. If you are not going to pass any parameters to your program, and your program does not require any specific actions to be performed before start, you can run it right from the editor.

2. The class that you are going to execute must contain a main() method with a valid signature, for example: public static void main(String[] args).

3. Click App actions execute in the gutter near the class declaration and select Run.

4. Run quick 1
5. To run a script, open it in the editor or select it in the Project tool window, and then select Run <script file name> from the context menu.

6. IntelliJ IDEA creates a temporary run/debug configuration of the type Node.js.

**How to run tests in INTELLIJ**
1. If your tests don't require any specific actions before start and you don't want to configure additional options, such as code coverage, you can run them by using the following options:

2. Place the caret at the test class to run all tests in that class, or at the test method, and press Ctrl+Shift+F10. Alternatively, click the gutter icon next to the test class or test method.

3. The gutter icon changes depending on the state of your test:

4. The the Run button gutter icon marks new tests.

5. The the Run test icon gutter icon marks successful tests.

6. The the Rerun the Run button gutter icon marks failed tests.

7. Running a test using the gutter icon
8. To run all tests in a folder, select this folder in the Project tool window and press Ctrl+Shift+F10 or select Run Tests in 'folder' from the context menu .
